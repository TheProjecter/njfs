NJFS(not just a file system) is a next generation file system which addresses the problem current file system cannot support sematical-based associal accecess to file. What is it mean? It means you can find you data in storage just by descripting what it is but not where it is. For example, you can find your music in njfs by supplying the infomation about the author,the album, the style and so on. The idea of njfs is from a paper "Hieryche file system is end" on hotos 09 and most work is based on research of MIT sematic file system.
